            For decades there have been many artists who have warned those getting into the industry of greedy and dangerous business executives. Although the music industry pushes boundaries and motivates pop culture, it can still stifle creatvity through toxic and greedy practices.

            One artist who is a prime example of this is Taylor Swift. Taken advantage of at a young age, her manager, Scooter Braun, stole the rights to all her music and now she is forced to rerelease most of her discography. Although this is a terrible situation, it shows how the music industry can shine lights on larger issues of society such as mysogyny and greedy, capitalist practices.
