            Fortunately, we have many role models within the music industry to look up to. However, there is still a dark side to the music industry. For decades there have been many artists who have warned those getting into the industry of greedy and dangerous business executives. Although the music industry pushes boundaries and motivates pop culture, it can still stifle creativity through toxic and greedy practices. Constricting and controlling contracts that push artist into debt, and toxic behaviors which trap artists into addiction and depression can both be commonly seen amongst the industry.

            One artist who is a prime example of this is Taylor Swift. Taken advantage of at a young age, her label was able to force her into signing away the master to all of her music released with them. After failing to buy back her masters, she has been forced to re-release almost her entire discography so that she can earn money for her work, instead of fueling a label that completely disregarded and disrespected her as a musician and simply a human being. Although this is a terrible situation, it shows how the music industry can shine a light on larger issues of society such as misogyny and greedy, capitalist practices. Since Taylor Swift is such a huge artist, she has been able to warn upcoming artists about what can happen when you don't read your contractâ€¦ carefully.
